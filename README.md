## Setting Up SSH Keys

Follow these steps to generate and add your SSH key to GitHub:

1. **Open Terminal**

    You can find Terminal in Applications â†’ Utilities or by using Spotlight (Cmd + Space and type "Terminal").

2. **Generate the SSH Key**

    Run the following command, replacing `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

3. **Save the SSH Key**

    When prompted with:

    ```bash
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_rsa):
    ```

    Press Enter to accept the default file location (`/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_rsa`).

4. **Add a Passphrase (Optional)**

    You will be asked to enter a passphrase for your SSH key:

    ```bash
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    ```

    You can either enter a secure passphrase or leave it blank by pressing Enter for no passphrase.

5. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**

    Start the ssh-agent by running:

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

    Then, add your SSH private key to the agent:

    ```bash
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

6. **Copy the SSH Key to the Clipboard**

    Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard by running:

    ```bash
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    This will copy the public key to your clipboard so you can easily paste it in the next step.

7. **Add the SSH Key to GitHub**

    - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
    - Navigate to **Settings** (click your profile picture in the upper right and select "Settings").
    - Click **SSH and GPG keys** from the sidebar.
    - Click **New SSH key**.
    - In the "Title" field, enter something descriptive like "My Mac SSH Key."
    - In the "Key" field, paste the SSH key (from Step 6).
    - Click **Add SSH key**.

8. **Test the SSH Connection**

    Now test the connection to GitHub to ensure everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

    You should see a message like:

    ```bash
    Hi <your_username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```
